# Country Data Interface

## About

A web interface for viewing and searching the country data provided by [this project][1].

Provides a filterable summary list of all countries and regions and a detail view for individual countries.

Intended for use on [countries.petethompson.net][2], but should be usable anywhere.

## Installation

To setup a usable version of this site:

1. Clone this repo to your webserver and point its document root to the `web/` directory.
2. If you have a Google Analytics code you'd like to use with the site, run `bin/deploy -g {Your tracking code here}`.

## Credits
